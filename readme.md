# The Nine Sectors of the U.S. Mexico Border Region

The U.S. Mexico border is divided into 9 different border patrol sectors. This is a project that allows you to sort and order the nine sectors by a range of metrics. For example, see how different sectors compare for categories like cocaine seizures, migrant apprehensions, or miles of fencing.
